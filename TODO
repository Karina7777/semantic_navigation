ActiveSupport helper methods:
  - Write specs for active_item_for if it getting block
  - Write wiki about that

Concept:
  - Rewrite leaf/node concept
  - Add possible to define renderers as templates
  - Add renderers for other template frameworks
  - Move bootstrap renderers to bootstrap version 4.0.0
  - Possible to make dynamic items in menu (database or something else)
  
Convention over configuration:
  - Move menu definitions outside the initializers folder
  - Leave menu configuration options in initalizers folder
